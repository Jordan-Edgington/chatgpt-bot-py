MacOS Instructions

You must have the OpenAI python library installed from: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python.

To create the alias you must open ~/.zshrc and enter:
alias chatgpt='~/<insert_filepath_to_file>'

After this you'll have to restart your terminal for it to work.

To run the program, you just type chatgpt in your terminal, and if aliased correctly, it should run.

Current functions:
 - Repeatedly asks for your input and provides responses.
 - Typing 'exit' will return you to your terminal.
